# My Personal Project


### Introduction

Basketball has been a part of my life for more than half my life. Not only do I play basketball, but I also coach basketball.
So, for my personal project, I would like to create an application that can keep track of my players stats **AND** also 
give feedback on what aspect they should work on. The application will also be able to provide specific game stats and 
season overall stats and comparisons from early season to the end of the season to check for improvement. The main focus 
for this project is for players and coaches to work together and identify what aspects they can work on.

### Who will use my application?

Since the main focus for this application is for team/player development, coaches and players will mainly use this application.

1. Coaches can:
   1. use this app to analyze their players shot percentage from across the whole court and see what improvements they can make
      1. eg. if free throw percentage is low, it would be something the app can say and suggest working on it
      2. be able to filter through players by position, or percentage. 
      3. be able to see stats of each individual game
   2. use this app to make decisions on game strategy, lineup decisions, and practice regimes

2. Players can:
   1. use this app to identify their weaknesses and determine areas for improvement
   2. set personal goals to reach by the end of the season

## Phase 4: Task 3 

If I had more time to work on my design prior to starting the project, 
I would plan to design a more intuitive GUI. The one I have now is very
simple and hard to navigate. Furthermore, I would try to implement the GUI 
in a different way. For example, coming up with a simple JFrame layout with 
panels to make the layout of each JFrame consistent. This would make the implementation
for the GUI a lot simpler and easier to follow and make changes. Another thing that
I would consider doing is coming up with other ways to display the statistics. A visual I would
consider is a graph comparing statistics to other players.
